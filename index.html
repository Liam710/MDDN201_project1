							<h2 class="white">CONCEPT.</h2><br>
							<p class="white">Gone Phishing as a concept aims to be an interactive and educational experience in which the user must discern between a legitimate article (such as a webpage from a trusted source, or an email requesting information) and a phishing attempt. There will be at least 1 detail that will give away whether or not the article is legitimate or not. Eventually the articles will become too hard to tell apart (by design) and a pop up will show up above the page, with an explanation about how some phishing attmepts can be indiscernable, and then provide (safe) links to anti-phising informational websites to educate the user further on what to look out for.</p>

							<h2 class="white">PRESENTATION AND TONE</h2>
							<p class="white">To appeal to a wide demographic, Gone Phishing is going to have a minimalistic design with a streamlined layout so that users with little knowledge can easily navigate it and not be turned off by a 'technical' looking website with intimidating menus, terminology, etc. The tone of the content will be a semi-formal presentation, not lecturing the user. For example, if the user guesses incorrectly, there will be no penalty but a helpful pop up will present what they got wrong, with an option to try again, or skip. This way the user does not feel punished, and also gets an opportunity to use their new knowledge to get the same article correct.</p>

							<h2>LOGO</h2>
							<img src="images/icon.png" alt="icon"/>
							<p>This is the icon for the product. Where there is either not enough space for the logotype, or it simply isn’t appropriate to use it, this is what should be used. Historically this is how phishing was discussed, elaborated by it’s wikipedia entry:The term was used because "<><" is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff. The symbol <>< was replaced for any wording that referred to stolen credit cards, accounts, or illegal activity. Since the symbol looked like a fish, and due to the popularity of phreaking it was adapted as "Phishing". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing</a></p>
